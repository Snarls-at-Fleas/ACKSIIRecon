// This is pseudocode for the app
// The app reads armies data from .json and checks their parameters against each other to find relevant modifier of the random roll.
// Then it makes the roll and finds what data about the army it should give to commanders of other armies.
// After that it outputs that data in clean format that can be copied and pasted to another app, messenger or text editor.
//
//
//
// open data.json for reading
// let i = number of armies included
// loop 1 to i
//
